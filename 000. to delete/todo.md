# TO DO
2. portfolio functions
- Portfolio props

3. contact section 
- Contact section = a contact form with fields for a name, an email address, and a message
- WHEN I move my cursor out of one of the form fields without entering text THEN I receive a notification that this field is required
- WHEN I enter text into the email address field THEN I receive a notification if I have entered an invalid email address
- **Note**: Because this application doesnâ€™t include a back end or connect to an API, the contact form doesn't need to save this information right now. You'll add back-end functionality in the next few weeks. In the meantime, consider including your email address and phone number on the Contact page.

4. styling
- use mobile-first design.
- navigation titles = the title corresponding to the current section is highlighted
- page style
- nav component
- header
- footer
- about
- contact
- error
- portfolio 
    - projects
- resume

5. application must be deployed to Netlify.

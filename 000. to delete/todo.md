## Acceptance Criteria

```md
- navigation titles = the title corresponding to the current section is highlighted
- About Me section = a recent photo or avatar of the developer and a short bio about them
- Resume section = link to a downloadable resume and a list of the developer’s proficiencies
- Portfolio props

- Contact section = a contact form with fields for a name, an email address, and a message
- WHEN I move my cursor out of one of the form fields without entering text THEN I receive a notification that this field is required
- WHEN I enter text into the email address field THEN I receive a notification if I have entered an invalid email address
```

**Note**: Because this application doesn’t include a back end or connect to an API, the contact form doesn't need to save this information right now. You'll add back-end functionality in the next few weeks. In the meantime, consider including your email address and phone number on the Contact page.
